# BURGER homework
## Set up
The initial set up for this application was difficult. This is the first application that I built that I had to connect both the frontend design to the backend server and database. I had a hard time understanding how everything went together at first, but as I worked through building out the appication I was better able to understand all the components.
## Technologies
I used Express.js to make my server connections. I built on ORM to handle the communication to the MySQL database. Handlebars.js was used for the front end design, along with Bootstrap.

## Difficulties
As I said before, I had a really hard time understand how all of the files interacted. At first I didn't really understand the need for so many files, but as I started putting everything together I started to understand that every piece was handling one specific job. Once I was able to see that, everything went a lot smoother. I also struggled setting up the buttons to properly interact with the database, even though I had previously worked with APIS and such. In the end I think I learned a lot of valuable things from this assignment that will transfer over into a lot of other things.
